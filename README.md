# üöó Car Price Prediction Models

This repository contains notebooks and scripts for predicting the price of second-hand cars using `km` and descriptive text fields. The workflow includes preprocessing text descriptions, generating embeddings, and building predictive models. To improve performance, **BETO**, a BERT-based model for Spanish, is utilized for contextual embeddings of text descriptions.

## üóÇÔ∏è Files and Techniques

### 1. **`Embedder.py`** üõ†Ô∏è
A utility script for generating Word2Vec embeddings from car descriptions.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal (Spanish-specific), and normalization.
  - **Word2Vec**: Trains a Word2Vec model on car descriptions with a specified vector size (`verb_size`).
  - **Average Embeddings**: Generates a single embedding for each description by averaging word vectors.

**Usage**:
```python
from Embedder import Embedder

# Initialize the Embedder
embedder = Embedder(verb_size=200, train=train_df)

# Generate embeddings for a text column
embeddings = embedder.embedding_process(train_df['full_description'])
```
